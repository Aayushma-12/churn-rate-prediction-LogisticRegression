# churn-rate-prediction-LogisticRegression
## Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to predict customer churn using Multinomial Logistic Regression. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visualizations, and the implementation of logistic regression for churn prediction.

## Features

### Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and outliers.
- Encoded categorical variables.
- Scaled features for optimal model performance.

### Data Visualization
- Created heatmaps, bar plots, and histograms to explore data.
- Analyzed churn trends and feature distributions to guide model development.

### Logistic Regression Implementation
- Applied SMOTE to balance the imbalance dataset.
- Applied hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy and avoid overfitting.

### Performance Evaluation
- Evaluated model using **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**.
- Visualized performance with a **confusion matrix**.
